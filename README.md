# Visualizing Temperature

## Objectives
* Build a page that uses data from the [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/dev) to render a line chart using [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/). It should look something like the picture below.

* Learn how to use `fetch` to keep data current.
* Use a JavaScript visualization library.

## Instructions
* Sign up for an account to generate a Dark Sky API Key [here](https://darksky.net/dev/register). You'll use this key for API calls.
* You'll be using [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) to visualize the JSON from Dark Sky so check it out. The `Chart.js` library is already linked in the head of your HTML file. Double check that the library is correctly linked by typing `Chart` into the browser's console. A function should be returned, not "undefined".
* Note that `script` tags for `weatherChart.js` and `init.js` are included in `index.html`.
* In `src/init.js`, assign the `API_KEY` variable to your Dark Sky API key.
* Also in `src/init.js`, the variable `URL` will be the URL that your code will use to fetch hourly JSON data on New York city's weather. This includes a CORS wrapper and a tag to just get hourly data. You can read the [docs](https://darksky.net/dev/docs) to get a sense of the exclude tags and read more about CORS [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).
* Get the weather data using a [`fetch` request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch). You can write your `fetch` inside the `makeRequest` function declared in `src/weatherChart.js`. The DarSky API will send back a [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) response.
* You'll have to fill out some helper functions in `src/weatherChart.js` that will help you format data from the DarkSky API:
  * `formatHours`
    * The DarkSky endpoint we're using returns time in milliseconds. You'll need to convert this into an array of hours in 24 hour time: `[1547236800, 1547240400, 1547244000]` should be `[15, 16, 17]`.
  * `formatFahrenheit`
    * The DarSky endpoint we're using returns an array of hourly data. Included in that array is a temperature for each hour. `formatFahrenheit` should return an array of temperatures that we'll pass to our chart.
<!-- * Associate each hour, in 24 hour time, with a temperature (in Fahrenheit). -->
* Use the data you found in the line above to make a line chart with Chart.js. Refer to its [line chart docs](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/#line-chart-example-usage) for help. Render the chart in the canvas with the id `NYCWeatherChart`.

### TIPS
* The time returned from the Dark Sky API will need to multiplied by 1000 in order to be used properly with the JavaScript [`Date` Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date). You will then need to convert the time, in milliseconds, to a particular hour in a day (in 24 hour time). For example:

```js
// `getHours` usage:
const rightNow = new Date(Date.now())
rightNow.getHours() // 14 (2PM)

// `getHours` usage with DarkSky response data:
const myDate = new Date(1547229600 * 1000)
myDate.getHours() // 13

```

* `Chart.JS` example for creating a chart:
  * `src/weatherChart.js` includes a helper function that will format the data for your chart properly.

```js
const ctx = document.querySelector("#NYCWeatherChart").getContext("2d");
const chart = new Chart(ctx, {
    // The type of chart we want to create
    type: "line",

    // The data for our dataset
    data: {
        labels: ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July"],
        datasets: [{
            label: "My First dataset",
            data: [0, 10, 5, 2, 20, 30, 45],
        }]
    },

    // Configuration options go here
    options: {}
});
```
